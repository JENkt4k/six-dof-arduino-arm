# six-dof-arduino-arm
A 3D Printed Robot Arm Controller Using cheapest components possible: Arduino Uno, 6 servos ( 1 XL, 3 M, 2 SM), and 16 Ch PWM, based on : https://thangs.com/designer/HowToMechatronics/3d-model/Robotic%20Arm%203D%20Model-38899

# Inspiration and 3D model
After struggling with 3D printing for over 13 years, I printed out this a while back (sometime afer 2022) but was disapointed in the control software I was using. I recently tried to use ChatGPT to see if it could compleet teh simplified code I no longer have faster than I did. It wasn't faster, but the libraries were far more terse and I wasn't wasting time on language selection. 

Biggest improvement since last shot. Gen AI and ChatGPT

Things that improved:
- Ardunino is aamazing!!!
- Adafruit libs given in GPT example were much more consice
- Refactoring to more modular code was the largest cost but was forced to reduce code drops and drifting. Large text prompts struggle bying a few hundred lines.
- less invbested in code. I'm ADHD and code obcessed. releasing imperfect code is terrifying, this is less so

TBC ...
