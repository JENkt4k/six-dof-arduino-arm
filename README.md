# Inspiration and 3D model
After struggling with 3D printing for over 13 years, I printed out this a while back (sometime after 2022) but was disappointed in the control software I was using. I recently tried to use ChatGPT to see if it could complete the simplified code I no longer have faster than I did. It wasn't faster, but the libraries were far more terse and I wasn't wasting time on language selection. 

Biggest improvement since last shot. Gen AI and ChatGPT

Things that improved:
- Ardunino is amazing!!!
- Adafruit libs given in GPT example were much more concise
- Refactoring to more modular code was the largest cost but was forced to reduce code drops and drifting. Large text prompts struggle being a few hundred lines.
- less invested in code. I'm ADHD and code obsessed. releasing imperfect code is terrifying, this is less so

## File Structure
```sql

/six-dof-arduino-arm
|-- app.py
|-- pwm_control_panel.py
|-- servo_slider.py
|-- arduino_manager.py
|-- servo_manager.py
|-- settings.py
|-- dialog.py
|-- images/
|   |-- arm_diagram.png
|   |-- servo_0.png
|   |-- servo_1.png
|   ... (and so on for each servo image)
|-- settings.pkl  (or some other settings storage file)
```

https://github.com/JENkt4k/six-dof-arduino-arm.git

Here's a breakdown of what each file and directory is used for:

* app.py: This is the entry point of your application. It initializes and runs the main application window and ties all the components together.
* pwm_control_panel.py: Contains the PWMControlPanel class responsible for creating and managing the set of servo sliders and their associated images.
* servo_slider.py: Contains the ServoSlider compound widget class which includes a slider, a label, and an entry widget for each servo.
arduino_manager.py: Manages the communication with the Arduino, including sending commands and connecting/disconnecting.
servo_manager.py: Handles the logic for updating servo positions, including debouncing and maintaining the state.
settings.py: Manages loading and saving user settings (e.g., number of servos, image paths).
dialog.py: Contains the SettingsDialog class that creates and manages the settings dialog window.
images/: A directory containing all the images used by the application, such as diagrams for each servo or a single arm diagram.
settings.pkl: A file where user settings are persisted between sessions. This might be a pickle file or another format like JSON or INI.
This structure keeps each component of the application isolated and focused on a single responsibility, which is beneficial for maintenance and scalability. It also makes it easy to locate files related to specific parts of the application.
